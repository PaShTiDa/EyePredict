if we'll use this, this is how to run EyePredict.py:

Treat it like a module: import file. 
This is good because it's secure, fast, and maintainable.
Code gets reused as it's supposed to be done.
Most Python libraries run using multiple methods stretched over lots of files. 
Highly recommended. Note that if your file is called file.py, your import should not include the .py extension at the end.

just to add a bit of detail to case #1: 
say you want to import fileB.py into fileA.py.
 assuming the files are in the same directory, inside fileA you'd write import fileB.
 then, inside fileA, you can call any function inside fileB like so: fileB.name_of_your_func(). 
 there's more options and details of course, but this will get you up and running.
